# Discrete-Math Assignment 1

The Rar file contains all the contents required for the program.

The first folder named "2018058&&2018227" contains the encryptionn program named "Discrete Math Encryption.cpp" along with the input file 
named "Assignment 1_Plaintext.txt" and a folder named "Decryption".

Encryption:
The encryption program asks for the shift value k from the user and after running and encrypting the input from "Assignment 1_Plaintext.txt", outputs the genereated cipher to "Assignment 1_Cipher.txt" in the root directory of the encryption program aswell as 
the Decryption folder.

Decryption:
The Decryption folder contain only the "Decryption Program.cpp" initially but after running the encryption program it contains the 
"Assignment 1_Cipher.txt" aswell. When you run the decryption program it takes input from the cipher file and outputs plain text to
"Assignment 1_plaintext_out.txt" in the root director of decryption program.

ps: Altough the assignment asked to allow only positive values for k, we made our code compatible with negative vlaues of k aswell
cause we are alpha programmers ;c ...
